                My Favorite Hobbies
                <br>
                Reading, Dancing, Coding, Building, Working Out, and Playing Games
            </h1>
            <p1>As you may have guessed from the title, I have a lot of hobbies. I couldn't try and choose one, but I decided to talk about all of the ones I like the most. I like reading, because I learn so much from books, and the stories are combined in my mind to create one big story. I write them down, and they actually boost my creatvity up. I wonder if any of the stories I write will ever get published, and that's what keeps me going when it comes to writing books(well, not actual books, although I do like to write as much as I can). Anyways, if there were no books to read, we would never be as educated as we are now. There wouldn't be a trusted way of spreading information. All of that means that books can not only help my writing skills, but we get a better understanding of the world in the author's point of view.

                <br>
                Something else that I like is dancing, because it not only helps me get active, but it also makes me happy. The only bad thing is when I am in a bad mood, I don't feel like dancing unless I put on a funny song. Nevertheless, dancing is my favorite. If I had to judge what was good before I knew about building and coding, I would have included only reading and dancing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Coding is another one of my hobbies that I just started recently, early this year. I like coding because it has introduced me to a new perspcetive of things I can like. I never used to like games so much, and it wouldn't have been on the list had I not learned coding and realized how hard it must be for people who make so many games and movies out of code. It takes a lot of time and I won't ever take these games and movies for granted anymore.
                <br>
                <br>
                I like building because just like coding, I can think out of the box. I mainly build with legos, but am ready to build with anything as long as I have the permission and materials to do it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I like working out because it helps me shed out some extra fat, and I gained a LOT of fat this year not being able to do much. It also helps tire me out, and I can sleep much better that way.
                <br>
                <br>
                I like playing just about any game(although I still do have a few exceptions when it comes to that). I'll explain. If you ask me to play an action game, I'm all up for it. An arcade game, not such a big fan. I can still play any game if it's fun, though, or if it includes any of the given hobbies above.

                My inspiration is Neil Armstrong.

                <br>
                Ever since I was four, I've always wanted to be an astronaut. Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the moon, greatly inspired me to be the first to go anywhere out of Earth's gravitational force. To read more visit this link-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong
